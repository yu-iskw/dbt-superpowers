## Purpose

## Tools

Wraps the following MCP tools from the `lightdash` server:

- `ldt__list_groups`
- `ldt__get_group`

## Safety Mode Compliance

- **Read-Only Tools**: `list_groups`, `get_group`, `list_group_members`.

## Behavior

1. **Group Discovery**: Use `list_groups` to see all groups in the organization.
